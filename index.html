            <h2>Pollution Solution: Scientists Develop Living Plastics That Degrade in Compost or Erosion</h2>

            <p>Plastics are widely used but difficult to degrade, posing an ecological challenge. A team from SIAT developed degradable “living plastics” using synthetic biology and polymer engineering. They engineered Bacillus subtilis spores to produce Burkholderia cepacia lipase (BC-lipase), an enzyme that breaks down plastic. These spores were mixed with poly(caprolactone) (PCL) to create the plastics, maintaining the material’s physical properties. When the plastic surface is eroded, the spores release the enzyme, leading to a nearly complete breakdown of the plastic.</p>

            <p>Researchers at Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNSIT) developed the personalised skin-integrated facial interface (or PSiFI), which uses machine learning to accurately identify emotions. According to the authors, this developed system is able to implement real-time emotion recognition with just a few learning steps and without complex measurement equipment. This opens up possibilities for portable emotion recognition devices and next-generation emotion-based digital platform services in the future.

            <time>7 November 2024</time>
            <p>A painting by an AI robot of the eminent World War Two codebreaker Alan Turing has sold for $1,084,800 (£836,667) at auction. The auction house said the historic sale "launches a new frontier in the global art market, establishing the auction benchmark for an artwork by a humanoid robot". It added that the work by Ai-Da Robot is "the first humanoid robot artist to have an artwork sold at auction."
